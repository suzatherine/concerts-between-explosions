00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.440
What do you associate your local train

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.915
station with? Going to and from work?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.430
Joe wanted to meet up with friends, or

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.290
maybe going to watch your local football

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.440
club for the weekend. in Kharkiv,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.630
hundreds of 1000s of people lived

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.520
underground in the metro station for

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.940
over half a year. I managed to leave the

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.130
city with my children, but we were only

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.020
one step away from sleeping on the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.380
station's marble floor and winter. Do

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.330
you remember this cartoon, Teenage

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.640
Mutant Ninja Turtles and how they lived

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.900
in sewers. It was like this. Some kids

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.875
didn't see the sun in the sky for weeks.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.110
But it was also well organized. With

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.470
spaces for food, water, charging mobile

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.190
phones at the Madison. The Revolution of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.770
Dignity taught us as a civic society how

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.800
to mobilize. And if you didn't have

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.220
this, I'm sorry, but let's rehearsal, we

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.985
would have been in a much worse place.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.380
But how to introduce the music concerts.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.850
The Tula Nicola yeska, and two

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.895
colleagues at heart give Music Fest

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.980
created in the metro station. The

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.500
bravery of those artists cannot be

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.031
measured.

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:42.335
[audio playing...]

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.040
It was clear that we couldn't go ahead

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.390
with a hike. If music first as

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.670
originally planned in March, it was

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.170
obvious. But for us as organizers, we

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.930
had a very big way that we must create

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.680
some kind of music event. We saw a big

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.730
need in the people. And really, this

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.310
concert was made to unite people because

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.700
they were in a really bad shape. The

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.250
safest and only place we could actually

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.110
do the concert in that period was the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.110
metro station. And we chose to call it

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.400
the concert between explosions. Because

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.010
it was literally like this huge

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.170
explosions before the concert during the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.810
concert. And often. It was obviously the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.090
only musicians who could participate

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.680
with those who stayed in high gear. But

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.440
it was more complicated than that. For a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.570
lot of people. Fear is paralyzing. And

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.880
it was hard to predict who would be able

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.620
to play in that moment. found five

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.380
musicians and it was enough because it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.130
made up the string quintet. Since love

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.080
criteria anchor and all who proceed on

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.470
violin to Jana to convey all the nice

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.720
crotch and stuff on cello and said he

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.960
decoded from double bass. One young

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.620
composer with a dimmer bottle, made the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.190
musical scores grating adaptation for

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.920
the five musicians. And we chose famous

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.380
Ukrainian songs were all people know the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.830
melodies. At the beginning of the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.950
concert, the president of HUD give Music

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.410
Fest and now despite the war, we are

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.220
starting our festival. Our mayor and the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.230
head of Harkey regional military

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.630
administration were both there. And I

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.250
thought they would live up to five

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.670
minutes. But they stayed for the whole

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.954
concert. It was very important

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.159
for the audience, it was actually the

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.199
first cultural event in the city. Before

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.855
that, it was totally suffering. Pain.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.550
horrible, terrible situation. It was the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.020
first event to remind us of peace. Like

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.340
it was before. During the concert, it

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.050
was visible have people transformed. You

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.470
could see this changes in how we started

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.585
to smile when musicians started playing

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.820
new ticket visitors what a moonlight

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:43.445
night. Very famous very few

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.750
people started to sing the song together

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.940
even if they didn't have voice singing

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.570
they joined in. And in the end, the team

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.140
performed prayer for Ukraine. It's 19th

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.470
century quite well known melody with the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.514
words

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.499
God save Ukraine. And it was a very

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:09.994
emotional end to the concert.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:13.199
This concert inspired a lot of people to

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.364
start doing different projects,

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.579
collaborations, creations working

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:19.439
together music festivals, art

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.169
exhibitions, joint projects, with kids

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.194
who continue to live in the Metro State.

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.699
Because before this, people were in a

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.499
kind of antibiotic state. It was like a

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:35.699
light switch that went gone.
